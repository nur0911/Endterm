# What is a Socket?
#
# A socket is a communication endpoint that allows processes to communicate over a computer network. Sockets provide a standard mechanism for processes on different devices to establish connections, exchange data, and communicate. They are widely used in network programming to enable communication between applications, whether on the same machine or across a network.
#
# Use Cases of Sockets:
#
# Client-Server Communication:
#
# Sockets are commonly used in client-server architectures where a server listens for incoming connections, and clients connect to the server to request or send data.
# Peer-to-Peer Communication:
#
# Sockets can be used for direct communication between two peers without a centralized server. This is common in applications like file sharing or chat applications.
# Real-Time Systems:
#
# Sockets are crucial in real-time systems where low-latency communication is essential, such as online gaming or live video streaming.
# Distributed Systems:
#
# In distributed systems, sockets facilitate communication between different nodes to coordinate tasks or share information.
# Web Servers and Clients:
#
# Web servers use sockets to listen for incoming HTTP requests, and web clients use sockets to establish connections to retrieve web pages or data.
# Messaging Systems:
#
# Sockets can be used in messaging systems to exchange messages between different components of a larger system.
