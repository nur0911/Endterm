# What is API?

# API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. They enable the integration of different software systems, allowing them to communicate and work together.
#
# Use Cases of API:

# Web APIs:
#
# Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are used to enable communication between different software systems over the internet.
# Use cases include retrieving data from a server, posting data to a server, or performing specific actions.
# Library APIs:
#
# Libraries often expose APIs that developers can use to interact with the functionality provided by the library.
# For example, Python's standard libraries and third-party libraries offer APIs that allow developers to leverage existing code.
# Operating System APIs:
#
# Operating systems provide APIs for applications to interact with the system's resources, such as file systems, network capabilities, and hardware.
# Database APIs:
#
# Databases often provide APIs for applications to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.
# Hardware APIs:
#
# Hardware devices like printers, cameras, and sensors may have APIs that allow software applications to communicate with and control these devices.
# Example of Using API with Python:
#
# Here's a simple example using the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the current weather for a specific city. You'll need an API key from OpenWeatherMap.
